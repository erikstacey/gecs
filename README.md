# General Entity Component System (GECS)

GECS is a lightweight C library which provides an optimized memory structure for applications which rely heavily on bulk processing of groups of similar data. The design philosophy of GECS focuses on
keeping the library lightweight and free of application-specific fluff, while remaining easy to use. Currently, this library is a work-in-progress with the basic memory structures implemented as well as the bulk of the component and entity management on the back-end. The current priority is to write the interface which the implementing developer will use to interact with the memory structure.
